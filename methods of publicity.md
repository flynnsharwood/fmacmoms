- More collabs with clubs - indirect publicity
- Posters
- Slide slips in people's rooms (maybe too invasive)
- more and better merch. non exclusive merch, but don't advertise the merch
- screening of compilation of best short films
- participation in fest. feels shitty but ppl will atleast know that the club isn't dead.
	- We could have a stand which kind of has a story mode, and we upload the best run on yt. (again, don't advertise this, ask them at the end)
	- For example it could be a kind of team vs team, or a battle royale style.
