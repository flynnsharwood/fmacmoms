Conclusions

- Scripts that we have 
	- we have Amal's script, his script has to be worked up upon, details discussed, refer mom.
	- Advay's script related to humble homages.
	- Popular hook song, people walking past thing on ltc road. Shaurya.
	- Google meet where we turn our camera off, and everyone is in the same room. idk whose idea this was.

- make a roadmap on gdocs, related to these scripts and the pr stunts. let's have a deadline, june end. we will discuss our pool of stuff at the start of july and figure out what to do - Archisha
- The script doesn't need to be a story necessarily, and can simply be flashy and engaging visuals
- The thing should not take so long that it turns out that we're the last guys to put out the orientation vid.
- We should start making dummy shots with phone, which should serve as scaffolding. -Amal
- We also discussed about advay's animation project.

- Pr related 
	- start by having them to guess how some particular films or a scene was made. 
	- For publicity for the orientation trailer, have it be a compilation of all the shit that was unexpected to us as freshers. 
	- Have a scriptwriting/any other vertical related contest that is not restricted to ppl from fmac. 
		- give them an ordinary object, and make it look amazing on screen. (advayâ€™s suggestion)
	- Storyboards for mafia, upload on insta
	- Storyboard animatic vs final film comparision.
	- posters
		- unique qr ode on the back of each poster.
		- It can be a set of instruction for an informal fmac recruitment -H
		- it can have cryptic notes, horror lore posters replacing normal fmac posters. - archisha
		- Before we paste the poster, we will paint/write something that makes people steal other posters as well. -H
		- A golden poster kind of thing, monetary incentives. Insider trading too. We can announce it on insta and email. 
	- pre release for mafia that is exclusive to fmac staff and friends. 
	- What if we hire/ask someone outside fmac to actively sabotage out recruitments. in a pr-boosting way or smth.
	- we really need a marketing team. 
	- We also need more networking sessions. We want some way to easily reach out to alumnis. what if you want to know how to get into film industry, we shhould be able to get this answer easily - archisha
- we can have storyboards, scripts etc be binded. Kind of anthologies. per sem.
