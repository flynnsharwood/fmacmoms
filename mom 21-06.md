Kernel event? Nope we don’t know about it.

Set of events that get features in brochure. These are essentially the main events of oasis. Metamorphosis has been our kernel even since a long time

We are changing focus from metamorphosis to film festival

Film fest is a sub-fest of oasis. It is a set of events that can be covered by multiple clubs, like matrix etc.   
HAS? Squid game event as well would  be a part of it. 

A grand innaug for this film fest on the day of oasis innaug. Make this innaug grand.   
Film fest events will be revealed in innaug. 

1. Make this innaug as grand as possible  
2. We need to plan something that’s not dependent on the popularity of guests.  
   1. We can make our own film and screen it.  
   2. Mime and dc makes their own films. We can screen these.   
   3. Hdc can perform in innaug.  
   4. More such things to be planned  
   5. Make it as grand as the main innaug  
   6. Pitch more events for this.  
   7. Mafia trailer  
3. Metamorphosis event- short film making competition.   
   1. Last to last time it was shit, try to ensure we get quality submissions.  
4. Hyper-cut event  
   1. Prize amount? Last time was 50k. Budget meet with stuccans.  
   2. Traditionally has been an ad making competition.  
   3. Advertise this as an editing battle/sport  
      1. Target people with insane editing skills.  
   4. Incentives \-   
      1. Top 5 get to wait what, do what with fmac?  
5. Stall setup  
   1. Apt2-act ?   
   2. Posters etc to sell  
      1. Check out soham deshpandey’s insta page for examples  
6. Escape room  
   1. Film related clues given  
7. Film screening, with guest too maybe.  
   1. Biswa pati sarkar was last to last year’s chief guest

Advay and amal’s idea

- Bad dubs concept  
- Iconic movie scenes  
- We ask the audience to fill in the dialogue of the person, and people vote on whose’s dialogue was the best (funniest/coolest etc)  
  - Where can we conduct this?   
    - Maybe nab?  
    - Fd room works too  
    - Would stall work? Back ground noise a problem.  
  - Dialogues recorded over the video, and then this can be posted on insta/given to the audience.   
  - Price ? \-50 rs to x  
  - Can be a group thing too  
  - Winner cna be announced at that moment itself, but we will be limited to the people present. So we can put it out at the end of the day maybe.

Dnd game (h)

- Worlds   
  - \-  Lord of the rings  
  - \-  Game of Thrones  
  - \-  Last of us  
  - \-  Resident evil  
- Integration with fcu?  
- 15 min per game approx  
    
    
  


Advay’s alternate ending idea

- Kind of a script writing competion  
- You decide a, and b, and they can decide how to connect those

Amal’s idea

- (entry criteria for this is to have a cohesive script already prepared). You, and your team, will be put through pre-production and production hell, as you will have to pitch various aspect of your project to a department head that is very brutal. The departments will be financing, cinematography, editing, vfx, script. The team that makes it through all of this will get a certain prize money.)  
- Kind of like shark tank for movies

Amal’s idea 2

- Team game  
- Give a team a few elements to make a specific part of the movie, like act 1, intro ending etc.   
- Team votes for themselves.   
- Team with most votes wins. 

Abhinav rathi’s idea

- Movie guessing related  
- 10 famous memes of famous movies, whoever recognises the most, moves to round 2  
- For round 2, we can play famous music  
- Last round would be a buzzer round. 5 famous dialogues of famous films, for example “with great power comes great responsibility”  
- q r code for fmac film?   
- Fmac logo at end?  
- We can collab with elas? Club for this.

Archisha’s idea

- Inspired by advay’s idea  
- For increasing female rep  
- Female exclusive?  
- Women empowerment, but written subtly?   
- Not a blatantly empowering movie.   
- Young adult fiction may be a better alternative. because smut-adjacent stuff is more common in bits-females

“archisha expand on this idea a bit, think about and come up with something concrete  
and we can incorporate it accordingly” \- shantnu

“I'll win every smut writing competition” \-shaurya (ofc)

Now on to recruitment ideas. SOmething like last sem? “No” \- all

SId

- We hold an orientation early, one of the first to do so.  
- Very very simple topics.   
- We can teach them format later, let them write a basic outline of a story.   
- Chit idea, like create story from say, 3 random words.  
  


Digant solani

1. We have a flawed conception of what it means to be a scriptwriter. We are essentially testing english skills. Stories are not necessarily script. Scriptwriting is not literature, firs comes learning to say a story, and then the next is what scriptwriting is.  
2. Stories aare an oral tradition. We should have tasks that test people’s storytelling skills.   
   1. Plot should be entertaining,  
   2. You should be able to convince people that it is a good story  
3. After students come right from jee, they can’t classify stuff like exposition etc consciously.   
4. We can have another meet about scriptwriter recruitment.  
5. Fuck format for now. 

Camera handling recruitment related

- Amal  
- Match cut, but   
- 3 different genres, they need to implement the list of shots given to them. Choose one of 3 scripts.  
- Shaurya  
  - List of movies will be given, (cinemetographically beautiful)   
    - They will have to analyse it  
      - This is probably be better for doing it for their own shots, during the 2nd round  
          
        

“First round hould always be low effort” \- jisne bola naam likh do

Shaurya had an idea for orientation trailer

- Flashy edits, on a popular insta music  
- Example shot \-
