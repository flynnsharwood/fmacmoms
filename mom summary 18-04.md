- post mortems or some kind of pressure to get the ghost members a little bit more active
- If ppl commit and then dip, mention it to seniors/coords. (aniket/mithilesh)
- If someone gets the time, try to document knowledge for juniors. The few videos we get for recruitment task aren't enough. Neither is photowalk.
- Photowalk can be made better by random shoots in pilani perhaps. This can also help solve bonding issue a bit.
- Gimbal and a7iii are permanently compromised. Inventory handling is shit. Prepare a system where proper logs are kept and they are up to date.
- we should have some exp before a freshers project. Mafia was helpful but there should be atleast a little oversight by a senior - praneet
- Any more lapses would cause the club to die.
- How to get more equipment / upgrade it - 
	- rich ppl from club
	- participating in competitions
	- Impress ppl from fmac parivar 
- We can't monetise our videos as we use copyrighted music
	- I say we make our own repo for ost. Sid made an ost for Artifice, we might be able to make enough music to last us for multiple projects.
- Tasks for freshies regarding spons and marketing - (by next wed)
	- [ ] Find ways to market our content
	- [ ] Ways to reach out to spons
- Thing related to mafia shoots is probably going to be dealt better in a post mortem for mafia. not including it in the summary. Neither the personal issues, which would hopefully be solved in private.
- Screenings and such activities might solve the bonding issue. 
- Apogee thing had transparency issues and shit.
- Tf is epm? still no clue. summarise what happened regarding this and reply, perhaps.
- Conduct a kind of politics session. Seniors will tell juniors about past and current beefs. This can be helpful for projects that require politics knowledge (example - election kettle)

The small groups that we discuss in right after the meet are just as (if not more) productive, atleast in indirect ways.

Also, I'm trying to research addictive substances that people actually use in campus, **any** help is appreciated.
