- Multi club event pitch
	- A event that lasts a week or so. 
	- Clubs organise skill sessions, where they teach stuff they're experts at.
	- for example
		- music club can teach music composition, and maybe sound design. 
		- Hdc can teach acting
		- We may teach editing and camera handling
	- We can make this open to non club members too, but it depends on how personal we want the skill sharing sessions to be, if too many people come, we will have to teach as if we are giving a lecture.
	- We might actually start a whole new culture on the campus.
- Copyright related discussion
	- A pitch deck to be made to get help from spons or humanities dept.
	- A spreadsheet to be made, with fmac movies in order of most views.
	- We will then try to ask them to come to fests, and the way abhinav got permission to use chaar diwari's music, we might try to get the music from those stuff sorted. We may be able to monetise them then
	- About copyrighting movies and scripts, this is to be discussed during or after the pitch deck is made, and we might discuss with humanities dept or spons dept abt this.
- Shifting the club to being self dependent (not using copyrighted material)
	- Let music club teach us composition so we can make our own music
	- Revoke their privilege to them getting free shooting from us if they disagree lol 
- recruitments
	- Try to find people who are enthusiastic about acting in addition to their selected vertical
	- Also music composition in addition to acting. These might get them brownie points during recruitments.
	- Acting vertical does not seem feasible yet.
- Asking coords to reach out to goa campus for Music composition. It can be a convo starter and we might get to know about how they make their own ost for a few films as well. (abhinav bhaiya's suggestion)


%%
- pitch to coords about acting, sound design or music composition vertical
	- for sound we can simply mention that we prefer them having interest or knowledge, in addition to whatever they bring for their vertical
	- same for acting. If not a vertical, atleast check if they seem willing to act in films.
	- According to a lot of people, acting vertical does have a lot of downsides and does not seem worth it.
- A multi club event where each club teaches what they are good at to others. This can be like the e week.
	- We need a club to teach us and new recruits about music and acting
	- we can offer to teach editing and camera handling.
	- This can be done between multiple clubs, most probably a music club, hdc and us
- copyrighting related info and discussion
	- Make a list of all the movies which have copyrighted stuff, and then who to sort it out with. 
	- approach those artists during fests to sort it out with them
	- We can eventually tick off as many as possible every fest
	- our movies can be then monetised
- shifting the club to not using copyrighted materials so we can actually monetise our stuff
- the results and feedback of the exposition competition. @Digant Fmac Solanki 
- overall, none of this matters if we don't produce good movies or mini series consistently.
