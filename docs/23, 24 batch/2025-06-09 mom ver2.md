Amal's ideas
- Merch
	- Internal and External
	- Monthly/bimonthly treasure hunt following subplot of FCU
	- consistent uploads of humble homages
	- help in shooting good quality ads for clubs and departments during fests, and we can charge money. This is not practical as everyone will be very busy. 
	- Cameo of faculty in films
(New ones) 
1. I have noticed that fmac productions dont usually have a color theory for the scenes/ dont have intensive colour grading. For that, im learning as much of colour theory as i can from my side 
2. I questioned actorâ€™s recruitment in fmac and abhinav bhaiya said that the actors recruited were lazy or something(something along those lines). If something can be done towards that matter, it will be fruitful, as more hands on deck = a more swifter and less hectic shoot.

Jayant -
