amal' script-

we start off with the grainy grayish fmac freshers intro we are used to seeing. 
one of the fmac guys behind the camera is asking some generic question like “what are your expectations from prom night” to the fmac recruits.
We get a jump cut between two groups (one fmac recruits, one general students) giving too). 
We then switch to a shooting style thats reminiscent of how the office/sucheir answers in the usualy corny fashion (poorly edited tcession were filmed. 
The guys behind the camera are ridiculing the answers, one of them says “they expect to pull with their virgin mannerisms?” %% we can tweak the dialogue later %% and start chuckling quietly among themselves. 
Then suddenly, the lights of the lamps go off. It gets completely dark for a moment. The fmac seniors are in shock. “what the fuck is going on?”, one of them says. suddenly a surge of yellowish light highlights one student, who has white eyes like a ghost (this effect can be done by photoshop/contact lenses). “Agar itna critical hona hi hai toh mujhe recruit hi kyu kiya?”. Blood slowly seeps from his eyeballs. Mouths agape. BLACK SCREEN. We then get a running montage of the fmac seniors escaping from the entity (whos probably the embodiment of the fmac god). %% musical montage %%
He consumes all of them one by one in various fashions. The last guy is running through rotunda with sweat all over his mouth and blood rushing from a cut on his forehead. 
He rushes to go hide inside a dimly lit nab room. He catches his breath and sits down letting out a sigh. He then takes out his phone and tries to open it, but it appears as if the battery is dead. 
“Shit, shit, ye sab abhi kyu hona hai” Then the lights go off. His eyes are darting around the interior of the pitch dark room. Then the light turns on to reveal the fmac god entity standing in front of him. He abruptly gets a hold of his chin, and commands him “go back in time(not this exact dialogue, i was thinking of something in sanskrit thats easily understandable)”. %% sanskrit? %%
AGAIN BLACK SCREEN. The character wakes up in an anc meeting with the same seniors that were killed by the fmac entity.
They question him “kya hogaya bhai” to which he doesnt give any response.
the camera slowly pans out on his deadpan tired face, with the people around him saying information about recruitments and stuff blah blah (i havent thought of dialogues of that).
red text displays text of orientation.

Amal believes the ending might need some revisiting, but the overall idea is good

Amal really wants Raafey ~~to be the fmac god. ~~

Shaurya
- Execution problems
	- only 10 days left,
	- editing might take time.
- Purpose of the trailer is to get freshers excited. The film is not giving a good example.
- 4-5 days should be max that we can give to this, we might even need to come to the campus early. 

Amal 
- suggests making dummy shots, which would serve as a scaffolding
- editing will take time though

Eyes effect
- contact lenses for the effect?
	- hygine problems
	- costly
- eyes glow at night under certain settings, this can be used, acc to advay.

blood tears
- blood used for mafia. 
	- shaurya points out that it didn't work near eyes.

Nab can be used. Nab washroom? for pre-ending part. 

How long is the film supposed to be, and what's the difference between it and a trailer. 

It doesn't need to be a story, it can just be ===flashy visuals===. 

It shouldn't take so long, that we're the last people to put out an orientation. 

would raafey be able to act?

Siddharth is 2nd priority for the fmac god character. according to amal.

Advay pitched a humble homage film. 

A guy pitches to seniors, but he keeps rewriting already written plot. 
Eventually he tries to use AI to write a script.
then fmac logo appears on screen. "don't fuck with this"

- This is probably better as not being the fresher's orientation. (? questionable statement)
- We slip in iconic moments from humble homages to show what he was imagining.

Shaurya

- use a popular hook song. %% hook song? %% %% cocaine smuggling? %% %% the muslim song hook (amal's suggestion) (fallaciously comparing all muslims to terrorists, very amicable behaviour, amal.) %%
- we can shoot this type of scene where people pass thruogh but one person is stationary. at low shutter speed. on ltc road.![[one-young-single-man-standing-alone-in-the-middle-of-a-crowded-street_hmtztmxs_thumbnail-1080_08-2111399992.png]]
- what is dfd? there is a scene from this. We can do this on rotunda. We can use loc footage? - shau
- For the busted gimbal we can use the chicken thing.

Advay's animation progress
