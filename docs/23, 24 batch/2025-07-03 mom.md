- BTS for oasis or Election kettle?
- we wern't allowed to use some particular audio because of bt with insti.
- is there an exact criteria that is followed to pick freshers for the freshers intro ya fir aise hi randomly we pick? - amal
	- We circulate a google form 
- Music composition - It should be an extra feature, they should still be interested in films
- Multi club event
	- The reason there are clubs is that they are specialised.
	- This knowledge transfer kind of thing, the need for each other's knowledge is not that intense. 
	- Workshops may work tho
- Acting
	- A separate vertical doesn't seem feasible
	- Digant suggests to integrate this in the scriptwriting recruitments itself
	- Don't outright call it an "acting/scriptwriter" vertical, but mention this after the first round probably
	- "Either be insanely good at the vertical or be decent at it, and be decent at acting" 
- Bits anthem trailer
	- We'll start work for anthem from tmr
	- We need all types of shots.
	- Videos for academics?
		- Challa ka prank?
		- "For challa" edits dropped by bits official page.
		- We need small clips only, try to get them.
- Amal's friend related. Music? 
- We are planning to assigning each of us a movie, 
	- Make a review post (you can reference the insta page)
		- 5-6 lines with a few pics.
		- You can also make it into a reel where you're explaining it. 
	- "What-if" reels series.
	- You can make a reel/edit of the movie too. (15-20 sec edit)
	- Assigned to everyone except the one making the orientation trailer.
- Humble homage ideas to be shot in the weekend challenges.
- When to start sem prod?
	- What stage is @siddhart 's  script is in?
	- Harshil's script is probably not to be shot in the first sem

An idea for humble homage by shahank bhaiya
- Kinds of kindness dance scene
- Half a min scene
- We have someone from dc, (tejas)
- Major point of audience won't know the context. (even most of us didn't know about this)
- SO don't let this be context dependent, but it should be executed well.
- A side by side comparison is doable too
